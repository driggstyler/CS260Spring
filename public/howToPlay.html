            <h2>How To Play Scattergories</h2>
            <p>Gameplay - A timer will be set for three minutes. In the time allotted, each player
                must attempt to think of and write down, in the first column on the pad, a word or
                term that fits each of the 12 categories and starts with the randomized letter. Any number
                of words in the answer is allowed, as long as the first word starts with the correct
                letter. For example, with a category of "vegetable" and a letter of "C", words such as
                "cauliflower", "carrot" and "collard greens" are acceptable, but "broccoli" is not
                (wrong initial letter), nor is "citrus" (wrong category). Writing a bad answer is still
                better than no answer though because there is always the possibility that the group
                playing will accept the answer. For example, "citrus" is "vegetable" in the sense
                referring to the entire plant kingdom, i.e. neither "animal" nor "mineral". All players
                stop writing when the timer is finished. 
            </p>
            <p>Voting - Following the list, each player, in turn, has their answer displayed before the group 
                for each category. Players score zero points if another player has listed the same answer and
                one point for an answer no other player has given. You cannot have more than one
                answer on a line for each number. If for some reason a
                player thinks someone's answer does not fit the category (for instance, "knuckle" for
                the category "types of sandwich") a player can vote against that answer. For each answer displayed, 
                all players vote on the validity of that answer. If the vote is a tie, the
                vote of the player who is being challenged is thrown out. In the case of general
                categories, broad interpretation is allowed for fun and creative game play. For
                example, in the case of things commonly found in the kitchen that start with the
                letter K, both knife (a kitchen tool) or Kelp, (a type of food that is commonly cooked
                in kitchens around the world) are acceptable answers. At the end of the game, the points are added 
                for each round and the player with the most points is declared the winner.
