5/10/23 - Today I learned how to use git commands and github through both the console and virtual studio code.
## CSS notes
You can make accordains to where either you can expand multiple (checkbox structure) or only a single (radio structure) tab of content.
You can have your own color name (midnightBlue) attatched to a fixed hexidecimal number. In SCSS, it is $midnightBlue: #FFFFFF and you put htis before the opening body tag. (Also learned to be aware of what kind of CSS I am looking at.)
Take the time to make the css of the main/home page as far as pure styling goes, it becomes 10 times easier to make the other css pages afterward.
There is a way to change solor of hyperlinks using something like a:link, but needs further personal study.
Sometimes copying and pasting names saves a lot of debbugging trouble.
Remember you can change css of things like h2 in certain elements and not on others, like h2 margins are bigger in the header and smaller in the main.
