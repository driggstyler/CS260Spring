5/10/23 - Today I learned how to use git commands and github through both the console and virtual studio code.
## CSS notes
You can make accordains to where either you can expand multiple (checkbox structure) or only a single (radio structure) tab of content.
You can have your own color name (midnightBlue) attatched to a fixed hexidecimal number. In SCSS, it is $midnightBlue: #FFFFFF and you put htis before the opening body tag. (Also learned to be aware of what kind of CSS I am looking at.)
